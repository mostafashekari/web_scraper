Here’s a complete `README.md` for your **Multithreaded Web Scraper** project:

---

# **Multithreaded Web Scraper**

This is a simple multithreaded web scraper built in Go using Goroutines and Channels. The scraper fetches the **title** and **meta description** from a list of provided URLs.

---

## **Features**
- **Concurrent Scraping**: Uses Goroutines for efficient multi-threaded scraping.
- **HTML Parsing**: Extracts `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags from web pages.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid URLs and parsing errors gracefully.
- **Customizable**: Easily add or modify URLs to scrape.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Go**: Programming language.
- **Goroutines**: Lightweight threads for concurrent scraping.
- **Channels**: Used to collect results from multiple Goroutines.
- **`golang.org/x/net/html`**: HTML parsing library.

---

## **Project Structure**
```
web_scraper/
├── main.go            # Main application file
├── go.mod             # Go module file
├── go.sum             # Dependencies file
```

---

## **Endpoints Scraped**

The scraper is configured to scrape the following URLs (you can update this list in `main.go`):
```plaintext
https://golang.org
https://www.google.com
https://www.github.com
```

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Install **Go**: [Download and install Go](https://go.dev/dl/).

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web_scraper.git
cd web_scraper
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

### **4. Run the Scraper**
Run the program:
```bash
go run main.go
```

---

## **Expected Output**

The program will output the **title** and **meta description** of the scraped URLs. Example:
```plaintext
URL: https://golang.org
Title: The Go Programming Language
Meta Description: An open-source programming language to make developers more productive.

URL: https://www.google.com
Title: Google
Meta Description: Search the world's information, including webpages, images, videos, and more.

URL: https://www.github.com
Title: GitHub: Where the world builds software · GitHub
Meta Description: GitHub is where over 100 million developers shape the future of software, together.
```

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Concurrency**:
   - Each URL is scraped in its own Goroutine.
   - A `sync.WaitGroup` ensures the main function waits for all Goroutines to complete.

2. **HTML Parsing**:
   - The `golang.org/x/net/html` package is used to parse the HTML of each page and extract the `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags.

3. **Channels**:
   - A buffered channel collects the results from all Goroutines, ensuring thread-safe communication.

---

## **Customizing URLs**

To scrape different websites:
1. Open the `main.go` file.
2. Update the `urls` slice:
   ```go
   urls := []string{
       "https://example.com",
       "https://another-example.com",
   }
   ```

---

## **Error Handling**

The scraper handles:
- Invalid URLs:
  ```plaintext
  Error fetching https://invalid-url.com: <error message>
  ```
- HTML parsing errors:
  ```plaintext
  Error parsing HTML of https://example.com: <error message>
  ```

---

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **Input from File**:
   - Allow URLs to be read from a text file.
2. **Output to File**:
   - Save results to a file (e.g., text or JSON).
3. **Timeout Handling**:
   - Add timeouts for HTTP requests to prevent hanging.
4. **More Metadata**:
   - Extract additional metadata like `<keywords>` or `<author>`.
